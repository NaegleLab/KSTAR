# Running KSTAR using multiprocessing

Within python, several KSTAR functions can be run in parallel using the multiprocessing module. For these functions, switching to multiprocessing
simply requires changing the 'PROCESSES' parameter from 1 (default) to the number of processes you would like to run in parallel.
```
# Activity Calculation
kinact_dict = calculate.run_kstar_analysis(experiment, activity_log, networks, PROCESSES = 4)

# Normalization
calculate.normalize_analysis(kinact_dict, activity_log, num_random_experiments, target_alpha, PROCESSES = 4)

# Mann Whitney Calculation
calculate.Mann_Whitney_analysis(kinact_dict, activity_log, number_sig_trials = 100, PROCESSES = 4)
```

While this strategy helps to improve the speed of analysis, it can be very memory intensive for large datasets. For large tyrosine datasets
and most serine/threonine datasets, we recommend running KSTAR using nextflow, described in the following section.
