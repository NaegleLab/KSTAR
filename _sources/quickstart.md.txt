# Quick Start Guide

Here, we have provided a quick start guide that will allow you to get up and running quickly, especially if you wish to simply use the
same pruned networks as utilized in the KSTAR paper. 

## Installation

KSTAR can be installed via `pip`, `conda`, tarball, and directly from the Git repository. We recommend using conda to install the scientific packages `conda install anaconda` before installing openensembles. 

### Pip

To install via pip, execute `pip install KSTAR`.

### Conda
To install via conda, execute `conda install -c naeglelab KSTAR`.

### Tarball

To install via a tarball, head over to the [Releases page](https://github.com/NaegleLab/KSTAR/releases) and download the latest stable tar release.

Afterwards, navigate to your downloads directory and execute the following commands, substituting <version> for the release's version number:
```
tar -xvf KSTAR-<version>.tar.gz
cd KSTAR-<version>
python setup.py install
```

### Git

If you want to try out the latest commit, you can install directly from the Git repository by executing the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/NaegleLab/KSTAR
cd KSTAR
python setup.py install
```

## Download resource files

We have provided all resource files required for running KSTAR in a publically available figshare, including the reference proteome from KinPred, 
the reference phosphoproteom from KinPred, and pruned KSTAR networks generated from NetworKIN. To download, follow these steps:

1. Go to [FigShare](https://figshare.com/articles/software/RESOURCE_FILES/14885121)
2. Download the RESOURCE_FILES, decrompress/unzip the files, and store in easily accessible folder.
3. Update config.py so that 'RESOURCE_DIR' points to the RESOURCE_FILES directory.

It is also possible to generate your own networks, either with a different weighted kinase-substrate graph, different pruning parameters, or both.
For details on how to generate your own networks, see the tutorial.

## Follow the provided tutorial

That is all you need to do to set up your KSTAR environment (see 'Running Large Datasets with Nextflow' if working with large datasets, as
set up is slightly different). We recommend working through the tutorial in the following section to get an idea of the KSTAR workflow, 
either with the example dataset provided in our supplementary data figshare or with your own dataset of interest. You will only need to follow 
the 'Generating Pruned Networks' section if you would like to use your own networks for analysis, otherwise go straight to 'Map Datasets to KinPred'.
