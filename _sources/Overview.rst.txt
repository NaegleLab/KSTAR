Overview
=============
KSTAR is a Python package for inferring kinase actiivities from phosphoproteomic data. It requires the following steps, given a phosphoproteomic dataset of interest.

1. Mapping: This maps the phosphosites of the dataset the KinPred resource, which is an ontology for substrates for kinase-substrate prediction algorithms.

2. Kinase Activity Calculation: Given sites identified in an experiment, for each experiment (column) in a dataset, calculate the likelihood that those sites were pulled randomly from the kinase-substrate networks. (Low pvalues means highly unlikely that data is randomly pulled)

3. Negative set generation and activity calculation: Given the distribution of study bias of the sites in each experiment for a dataset, generate random datasets and repeat activity calculation. 

4. Normalization: Use the random datasets to normalize/interpret the calculations within the real experiments.

5. Analysis/Plotting: Use the post-normalized activity calculations to plot/infer kinase activities within the dataset of interest.
