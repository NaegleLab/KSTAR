    "Prior to predicting kinase activities, datasets need to be mapped to KinPred to obtain the Uniprot ID, phosphosite, and the +/-7 peptide sequence that will be used by KSTAR to identify which kinases are associated with each phosphosite. In order to map kinase activities, the dataframe containing phosphoproteomic data should contain each peptides Uniprot accession, as well as either the site number or peptide sequence. If the peptide sequence is used, it should be formatted with only the phosphorylated peptides being lowercased. For example, if a peptide sequence is annotated with '(ph)' in front of the phosphorylated amino acid, you would need to remove the '(ph)' from the sequence and lowercase the phosphorylated amino acid. So, the peptide sequence SGLAYCPND(ph)YHQLFSPR would become SGLAYCPNDyHQLFSPR.\n",
