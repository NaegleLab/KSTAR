    "## Download and Process Dataset of Interest\n",
    "Prior to predicting kinase activities, datasets need to be mapped to KinPred to obtain the Uniprot ID, phosphosite, and the +/-7 peptide sequence that will be used by KSTAR to identify which kinases are associated with each phosphosite. In order to map kinase activities, the dataframe containing phosphoproteomic data should contain each peptides Uniprot accession, as well as either the site number or peptide sequence. If the peptide sequence is used, it should be formatted with only the phosphorylated peptides being lowercased. For example, if a peptide sequence is annotated with '(ph)' in front of the phosphorylated amino acid, you would need to remove the '(ph)' from the sequence and lowercase the phosphorylated amino acid. So, the peptide sequence SGLAYCPND(ph)YHQLFSPR would become SGLAYCPNDyHQLFSPR.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended to use the peptide sequence rather than the site number when possible, as this is more likely to be found in the most recent version of KinPred. An example of the processed dataset can be seen below, which is a trimmed, processed, and mapped version of the dataset published publically (Chylek, 2014). You can download this data from the original publication below or the pre-mapped version at [FigShare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/KSTAR_Supplementary_Data/14919726).\n",

Either can provide a list of column names, or if is None, KSTAR will look for any column that contains 'data:' at the beginning of the name. Since the example dataset includes this 'data:' format, we will set this parameter to None.\n",

As such, we will set this to be 'mean'. Other options include 'max' or 'min', which will take the maximum or minimum value seen across multiple sites. Last option is 'count', which will count the number of times a site appears across the dataset. This is good if you would like to use all sites observed in a sample (set threshold to 1).\n",

We are interested in knowing which kinases activate upon TCR stimulation, so we want to look at phosphorylation sites with phosphorylation. For this reason, we will set greater = True.\n",

If we look at the original data, abundance values are relative to the 0 minute timepoint and appear to be log transformed. We want to focus on kinases that have increased activity after stimulation, so we think that 0.2 (phosphorylation sites logfold change >0.2 used as evidnece) will be  a good threshold.\n",

Instead of using a threshold, this parameter will force all samples to use the same number of phosphorylation sites as evidence for prediction for each sample. For example, if evidence_size = 100 and greater = True, the 100 sites with the highest quantification values are pulled for each sample. This approach has not been extensively tested, so we only recommend this approach if thresholding produces a wide variety of evidence sizes."
